## Introduction

The goal of this project is to gain insights into student performance by predicting grades through data analysis. Whether you're an educator, data scientist, or someone interested in education trends, this repository aims to offer valuable information and visualizations.

## Data Sources

The analysis relies on a dataset from a reputable source:

- [Student Grade Dataset](#https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipam7/student-grade-prediction) - Description of the dataset containing student information and corresponding grades.

## Analysis

The analysis covers a wide range of aspects, such as:

- Demographic factors (e.g., age, gender).
- Study habits (e.g., study time, attendance).
- Correlation between various features and student grades.

The code for the analysis can be found in the [analysis](/analysis) directory.

## Findings: Relationship Between Age and Sex

In this analysis, we explore the relationship between the age and sex of individuals, seeking insights into potential patterns and correlations within the dataset.

### 1. Age Distribution by Sex

- **Visualization:** Utilizing histograms or kernel density plots, we illustrate the distribution of ages for different sexes.
 
- **Observations:** Preliminary insights may reveal variations in age distribution, providing an overview of the age demographics for each sex.

### 2. Statistical Analysis

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for age by sex.
 
- **Comparisons:** Statistical tests or visualizations may highlight any significant differences in the central tendency and variability of ages between sexes.

### 3. Age-Grouped Analysis

- **Stratification:** Dividing the dataset into age groups (e.g., young adults, middle-aged, seniors) and examining the distribution by sex.
 
- **Insights:** Observing age-specific patterns may reveal whether certain age groups exhibit notable differences in sex distribution.

### 4. Machine Learning Predictions

- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict sex based on age.
 
- **Model Performance:** Evaluating the model's accuracy, precision, and recall provides insights into the predictive power of age in determining sex.

### 5. Correlation Analysis

- **Correlation Coefficient:** Calculating the correlation coefficient between age and sex.
 
- **Insights:** A correlation analysis helps quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between age and sex.

These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how age and sex may be interconnected within the dataset. Explore the detailed visualizations and analysis code in the [findings](/findings) directory for a more comprehensive exploration of these insights.
